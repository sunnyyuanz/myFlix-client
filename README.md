## Overview

Using React, build the client-side for an application called myFlix based on
its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

### The challenge

● As a user, I want to be able to access information on movies, directors, and genres so that I
can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
● As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.
